## Introduction to Cloud Computing and AWS

### What is cloud

[Cloud computing](#https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing) refers to the delivery of computing services, like storage and processing, over the internet rather than relying on local data centers. AWS provides these services through a global network of servers organized in data centers.

[Virtualization](#https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/virtualization/) is a key technology that allows AWS to divide physical servers into virtual machines (VMs). Each VM operates independently with its own resources (e.g., memory, storage) and is offered on a pay-as-you-go basis, similar to utilities like electricity.

Cloud computing enables businesses to scale without upfront infrastructure costs, with AWS offering services across various categories, such as:

    Compute (e.g., EC2)
    Storage (e.g., S3)
    Networking (e.g., VPC)
    Security (e.g., IAM)

By familiarizing yourself with these categories, you gain a better understanding of how AWS services work and can utilize them efficiently.

### Introducing Cloud Computing and Deployment Models

In this lesson, we explore the key concepts of cloud computing, comparing **CapEx** (Capital Expenditures) with **OpEx** (Operating Expenses), followed by an introduction to cloud computing models and deployment models.

### CapEx vs. OpEx

- **CapEx**: Upfront investments in fixed assets like equipment, property, and software.
- **OpEx**: Ongoing costs to support daily operations, such as salaries, rent, and utilities.

### Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. **Global Deployment**: Launch applications worldwide at the click of a button.
2. **Focus on Development**: AWS manages the infrastructure, allowing you to focus on building applications.
3. **Lower Costs**: AWSâ€™s scale enables lower pay-as-you-go prices.
4. **Faster Innovation**: AWS services help speed up development and delivery.
5. **Elasticity**: Resources scale automatically with demand.
6. **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use without upfront investments.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **High Availability**: Systems designed to operate continuously with minimal failures.
- **Elasticity**: Provision resources as needed, saving time and costs.
- **Agility**: Cloud services allow for faster innovation and speed to market.
- **Durability**: Long-term data protection ensures data integrity.

### Cloud Computing Models

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Rent and manage building blocks like servers and networks. Example: AWS EC2.
2. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Use complete applications on demand. Example: Web-based email.
3. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Provides tools for developers to build applications without managing underlying infrastructure. Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### Cloud Deployment Models

1. **Private Cloud**: Resources are hosted on-premises, providing more control and security but lacking cloud flexibility.
2. **Public Cloud**: AWS, Azure, GCP provide the hardware and services, offering all cloud benefits like scalability and cost-efficiency.
3. **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines private and public clouds, often with sensitive data stored locally while leveraging cloud services for scalability. Secure connections such as VPN or AWS Direct Connect link private and public clouds.

## AWS Availability Zones (AZs)

### AWS Regions

An AWS **Region** is a physical location that groups AWS services and infrastructure based on geographic areas. Each region operates independently and is isolated from other regions, ensuring that if one region is affected by an event such as a natural disaster, other regions remain unaffected. Resources and services within a region do not automatically replicate to other regions, so replication must be done manually.

For example, the **US East** geographic location includes the **Ohio** and **North Virginia** regions. Each region is designed to provide independence in terms of resource management and failure isolation.

### AWS Availability Zones (AZs)

AWS regions consist of multiple **Availability Zones (AZs)**, which are sets of one or more data centers located in separate facilities within a region. Each AZ has independent power, networking, and connectivity, ensuring fault tolerance. While the number of data centers in an AZ is not explicitly documented by AWS, an AZ typically consists of several discrete data centers.

AZs are connected via low-latency links to ensure high availability. If one AZ experiences failure, applications running across multiple AZs will remain functional in the remaining zones. This redundancy supports both **high availability** and **fault tolerance** for critical applications.

### Key Characteristics

- **Regions** are isolated and resource-specific.
- **Availability Zones** are fault-tolerant and connected via low-latency links.
- Deploying applications across multiple AZs enhances both high availability and fault tolerance.

### Scenarios

- An application running in a single AZ (e.g., **us-east-1a**) is **not fault-tolerant**. For fault tolerance, it must span multiple AZs.
- If an application running across multiple AZs experiences downtime, the entire region may be out of service.

## Edge Locations and Local Zones

### Latency

**Latency** refers to the amount of time between a user's request and the corresponding response from a server. Lower latency is desirable as it means faster load times and a better user experience.

### Local Zones

**Local Zones** are extensions of AWS Regions that place compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer to end-users. This proximity allows for applications that require ultra-low latency, typically in the single-digit milliseconds, such as real-time gaming or live video streaming.

Key characteristics of Local Zones:

- Extend AWS Regions by providing infrastructure closer to users.
- Offer high-bandwidth and secure connections between local workloads and those running in the parent AWS Region.
- Ideal for latency-sensitive applications.

### Edge Locations

**Edge Locations** are sites that AWS CloudFront uses to cache copies of your content for faster delivery to users across the globe. They are not used to launch resources but serve as global endpoints to reduce latency by delivering content closer to where users are located.

Key characteristics of Edge Locations:

- Help reduce latency by caching content via AWS CloudFront.
- There are more Edge Locations than AWS Regions and Availability Zones.
- Utilize the AWS global network backbone for efficient content delivery.

### Scenarios

1. **Scenario**: You need to ensure millisecond latency for a new application.
   - **Solution**: Use **Local Zones** to place services closer to end-users.

2. **Scenario**: You want to lower latency for a website available on two continents.
   - **Solution**: Utilize **Edge Locations** through AWS CloudFront to cache content closer to users.

## AWS Management Console and Accessing AWS

### AWS Management Console

The **AWS Management Console** is the most popular and user-friendly way to interact with AWS resources, accessible via a web browser. It is especially useful for non-technical roles, like project managers, as well as technical roles such as engineers or developers. The console allows users to search for services, create, modify, or terminate resources within an AWS account.

#### Root User

The **root user** is the most powerful account in AWS. It is created when setting up an AWS account and has full control, including the ability to delete the account and all resources. For security, it is critical to:
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** on the root user.
- Avoid using the root user for day-to-day tasks. Instead, create new users or groups using **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**.

#### Other Ways to Access AWS

- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: The CLI allows access to AWS resources through a terminal using commands. It is preferred by developers and engineers for automating tasks and gaining programmatic access via API calls.
  
- **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: SDKs allow developers to interact with AWS resources programmatically using languages like Java, Python, and C#. They provide another way to access AWS outside the console.
